# cahode
A private P2P terminal video chat app

***
Cathode is a weakly-interacting coupling of two peices of software. First we start with [p2pvc](https://github.com/mofarrell/p2pvc) (the brilliant little app that renders the audio/video in your terminal), and [ZeroTier]() (an extremely small but very robust encrypted P2P VPN layer). We then replace all of the socket API system calls with their ZeroTierSDK equivalents aaaaannnd we're done.
